Let’s explore another powerful object-oriented programming tool: inheritance. Suppose
we want to write `Dog` and `Cat` classes. Here’s our first attempt:

```python
class Dog(object):
    def __init__(self, name, owner, color):
        self.name = name
        self.owner = owner
        self.color = color
    def eat(self, thing):
        print(self.name + " ate a " + str(thing) + "!")
    def talk(self):
        return self.name + " says woof!"

class Cat(object):
    def __init__(self, name, owner, lives=9):
        self.name = name
        self.owner = owner
        self.lives = lives
    def eat(self, thing):
        print(self.name + " ate a " + str(thing) + "!")
    def talk(self):
        return self.name + " says meow!"
```

Notice that both the `Dog` and `Cat` classes have `name`, `owner`, `eat` method, and `talk` methods. 
That’s a lot of effort for so much repeated code!

This is where inheritance comes in. In Python, a class can inherit the instance variables
and methods of a another class without having to type them all out again. For example:

```python
class Foo(object):
    # This is the superclass
    
class Bar(Foo):
    # This is the subclass
```

`Bar` inherits from `Foo`. We call Foo the `superclass` (the class that is being inherited) and
Bar the `subclass` (the class that does the inheriting).

Notice that Foo also inherits from the object class. In Python, `object` is the top-level
superclass; everything inherits from it, whether directly or through other superclasses.
object provides basic functionality that is needed for other classes to work with Python.

### When should we use inheritance?

One common use of inheritance is to represent a hierarchical relationship between two or
more classes – one class is a more specific version of the other class. For example, dogs
are a specific type of pet, and a pet is a specific type of animal.

Using inheritance, here is a second attempt at representing dogs.

```python
class Pet(object):
    def __init__(self, name, owner):
        self.is_alive = True # It’s alive!!!
        self.name = name
        self.owner = owner
    def eat(self, thing):
        print(self.name + " ate a " + str(thing) + "!")
    def talk(self):
        print(’...’)
        
class Dog(Pet):
    def __init__(self, name, owner, color):
        Pet.__init__(self, name, owner)
        self.color = color
    def talk(self):
        print(’woof!’)
```

Notice that, by using inheritance, we did not have to redefine `self.name`, `self.owner`,
or the `eat` method. We did, however, redefine the talk method in the `Dog` class. In this
case, we want `Dogs` to `talk` differently, so we override the method.

The line `Pet. init (self, name, owner)` in the `Dog` class is necessary for inheriting
the instance attributes `self.is_alive`, `self.name`, and `self.owner`. Without
this line,`Dog` will never inherit those instance attributes. Notice that when we call
`Pet__init__`, we need to pass in `self`, since `Pet` is a class, not an instance.

### Questions

***1.*** Implement the `Cat` class by inheriting from the `Pet` class. Make sure to use superclass
methods wherever possible. In addition, add a `lose_life` method to the `Cat` class.

```python
class Cat(Pet):
    def __init__(self, name, owner, lives=9):
    
    
    
    
    def talk(self):
        """A cat says meow! when asked to talk."""
        
        
        
        
    def lose_life(self):
        """A cat can only lose a life if they have at least
        one life. When lives reach zero, the ’is_alive’
        variable becomes False.
        """
        
        
```

### Answer 1

```python
class Pet(object):
    def __init__(self, name, owner):
        self.is_alive = True # It’s alive!!!
        self.name = name
        self.owner = owner
    def eat(self, thing):
        print(self.name + " ate a " + str(thing) + "!")
    def talk(self):
        print("...")
        
        
class Cat(Pet):
    def __init__(self, name, owner, lives=9):
    	Pet.__init__(self, name, owner)
    	self.lives = lives
    	
    def talk(self):
    	print(self.name + " says meow!")
    
    def lose_life(self):
    	if (self.lives >= 1):
    		self.lives -= 1
    		print(self.name + " has lost a life and is now down to " + str(self.lives) + " lives left")
    	else:
    		Pet.is_alive = False
    		if (Pet.is_alive == False):
    			print(self.name + " has lost it's last life, and is now dead")
```

***2.*** Assume these commands are entered in order. What would Python output?

```python
class Foo(object):
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.a = a
    def garply(self):
        return self.baz(self.a)
        
class Bar(Foo):
    a = 1
    def baz(self, val):
        return val
        
f = Foo(4)
b = Bar(3)
print(f.a)
# prints what ?

print(b.a)
# prints what ?

print(f.garply())
# prints what ?

print(b.garply())
# prints what ?

b.a = 9
print(b.garply())
# prints what ?

f.baz = lambda val: val * val
print(f.garply())
# prints what ?
```
